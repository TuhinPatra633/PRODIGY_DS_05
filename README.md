# US Accident Data Analysis

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on US accident data. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents).

## Repository Structure

- **us_accident_data_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the code for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on data sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents).

# Project Overview

In this project, I perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on US accident data to uncover insights and patterns. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data cleaning, and preparation.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the data better.
3. **Visualization**: Various plots and graphs to represent the findings.

## Key Findings:

1. **Accident Trends**: Analysis of accident trends over time, including peak hours, days, and months.
2. **Geographical Insights**: Understanding the geographical distribution of accidents.
3. **Weather Conditions**: Impact of weather conditions on the occurrence of accidents.

## Further Details:

For a detailed analysis and visualizations, refer to the `us_accident_data_analysis.ipynb` file in this repository.
